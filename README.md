# Feature-Extraction-and-Price-Prediction-for-Mobile-Phones-Project---4
The goal of this project is to predict the prices of mobile phones based on various features such as model,color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, camera specifications, AI lens presence, mobile height, and processor type. The dataset used for this analysis is the "Processed_Flipdata" dataset, which contains information about these features as well as the corresponding prices of the mobile phones.
